# Alarm Clock with GUI
Alarm clock with simple GUI which displays the current time and allows the user to set an alarm to ring at a specified time.

This was my first project using the Kivy framework to create a GUI. Since then, I have created two mobile app's using Kivy: [Re:Cycle](https://github.com/orlandoalexander/recycle-mobile-app/blob/main/application.py) and [SmartBell](https://github.com/orlandoalexander/ComputerScience-NEA-App).

Check out my [blog post](https://wordpress.com/post/orlandoalexander.wordpress.com/151) about this project!
